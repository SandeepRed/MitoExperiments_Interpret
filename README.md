# MitoExperiments_Interpret

====

This code runs the simulations described throughout the manuscript, and generates associated Figures.

 

The ‘Matlab_Simulate_defects’ folder contains Matlab code to simulate different mitochondrial defects. File names start Sim_ 1: For Baseline: Sim_Basal_Control_simulations.m 2: For all defects and all experiments: Sim_AllDefects_allexps.m

 

The ‘Python’ folder contains data files and Python code to group/categorise the data and plot the appropriate figures. e.g. Pink1_Defects_7_Bins.py can be used when new experimental datapoints are there and for clustering to identify the possible defects

 

We simulated all experimental parameters described in the manuscript, in the presence of all impairments, and provide all outputs in the excel file (Chenna-2024-Supp-Data.xslx), which has simulated defects (known mitochondrial defects). The first sheet has guidelines on how to use the resource.
