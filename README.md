# MitoExperiments_Interpret

The Matlab simulate file can be used for simulating different defects:
File name starts starts Sim_
1: For Baseline: Sim_Basal_Control_simulations.m
2: For all defects and all experiments: Sim_AllDefects_allexps.m



The python file bins the data and is to be appropriate plots:
e.g. Pink1_Defects_7_Bins.py Can be used when new experimental datapoints are there and for clustering to identify the possible defects
